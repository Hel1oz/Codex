# About Codex

Hi! Thank you for checking out Codex, I hope you'll find this piece of software valuable and easy to use. I created this ebook reader because I found that the ones available to me for free were inadequate, had complex, unintuitive UI,  and more. I just wanted to have something that was simple and worked, I originally wasn't a programming guy, but as a guy fresh out of high school I needed to figure out where to take my life forwards, I decided I might as well learn how to make apps, I originally tried making android apps but once my brother who is a CS graduate found out, he showed me the wonderful framework called Flutter. And that's basically how it started.   

# The main goal of Codex
The main goal of codex is to offer an ebook reading app that has modern intuitive UI.

# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.
	> To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.

- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**.
	> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.

## Open a file

You can open a file from **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from**. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.

## Save a file

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.
