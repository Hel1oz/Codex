First 

set up the hive box to store values that aren't primitve data: Learn that shit.
	which means 
		learn how hive stores non primitive data
		learn how I can generate the file identifier, the metadata and partial hash.
		then learn how I'm going to represent the book's viewing data, how I should use it.
Then create that shit.
After that you will have to create the code that will make the app scan the available files
Make the code that will show the files based on the scan,
Then figure out how you can generate the identifiers, but wait, this part is required for the key,
how will I know what the key will be like?

Todos in the future:
	error handling:
		for hive, 



Urgent:
	Create the code to show the books in the folder.
