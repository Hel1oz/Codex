todo: get the boxshadow colors right [complete]
todo: write down what I want my book viewer to look like, business logic etc, [ongoing]

Single page and double page,
zoomable,

when in single page, user can either use their mouse wheel to scroll up or down, and they can use buttons to 
go to the next or previous page

Single page
 - scrollable, 
 - change page by arrow buttons

Double page
 - scroll changes pages,
 - arrow buttons changes pages,
 - zoomable, by using PdfViewer and configuring it to be facing pages. 
 ? Should I allow free horizontal scroll? Yes, along with the conventional double page,
 ? should I add the pages number on the title bar or below the book view? Perhaps even on the tools panel
 - pdf page should have dark mode, where the page turns into a darker color and the text turns
   into a brighter color,
 -   

sunk cost fallacy, I have to reflect on that.
idea: I think I should place the focus button on the title bar as to not obscure the main view,
idea: I think I shoulda add a way to transition between pages, yes using a ease in opacity transition
