todo:

Change the icons to something better,
and use different fonts, or maybe differnet sizes etc. 

and then use something like an incomplete order that is more free floating 
and get rid of the button diff color, just make it the same as the background, it will change color when hovered and when clicked
which after it will maintain a different color.
